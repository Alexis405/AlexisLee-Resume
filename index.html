        </h1>Management
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Alexis Lee and I am a second-year student pursuing a BS in Business Administration at the University of California, Riverside, with an emphasis on management. I was born and raised in New York, while also having an experience living in Japan as well. I currently reside in Los Angeles to pursue a higher education. I am both half-Korean and half-Japanese, but I am more in touch with my Japanese side because I was mainly raised by my mother, who is Japanese. But living in Japan has opened me to new experiences because living in a different country other than the place you were born in can be an eye-opening experience. But the reason I moved back to Los Angeles was because I wanted a better education for my future. While in Japan, I struggled with school, and did not have any motivation to do anything. But ever since I moved back, my life turned around drastically. First, I was able to make better studying habits, and became more curious with my studies. I also met an amazing group of people who I now consider my best friends.
And most of all, I felt the most confident I ever felt. I used to be a fairly shy person, but by practicing socializing and being less worried about what people thought of me, my confidence bursted through the roof. 
<br><br>

        As for work/volunteer experience, I was able to work with many different kinds of people, and gain new experiences. My first part time job was a sales representative for Vector Marketing, which is a company that sells CUTCO cutlery, which is based here in the US. My job was to sell and promote CUTCO cutlery to my close relatives, while also gaining connections through those relatives. This job has helped me gain essential customer service skills because this job is all about getting to know your customers, while also ensuring that they have a great experience with me as their seller. I also gained volunteer experience at a music festival in Japan called the â€˜World Music Dance Festivalâ€™, which was an event with artists from around the world coming to perform their music. The event happened in a city called Hakodate in the Hokkaido prefecture, which is in the North of Japan. I was able to get hands-on experience working at the front reception. Not only did I get to learn how to communicate with my team members, but I also worked as a translator since I can speak both English and Japanese. Currently, I work for the dining services on-campus at the University of California, Riverside. This job is helping me to refine certain skills like teamwork, communication, and toleration.<br><br>

        As much as I gained so much experience through all these jobs and volunteering, I am always hungry for more. I believe that there is always something new you can learn everyday, and I am eager to expand upon those skills and gain insight on different perspectives. I am currently seeking to build connections, gain new experiences, and expand my knowledge to get ready for the real world. I am always open to meeting new people, so please feel free to reach out!
